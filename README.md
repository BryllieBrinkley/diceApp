# diceApp

This is a visually appealing dice app that I developed, and its function allows users to tap the 'Roll' button, causing both dice faces to change randomly. While developing this app, I gained a wealth of knowledge including cloning existing Xcode projects from GitHub, adhering to naming conventions in Swift, designing user interfaces, using string interpolation, programmatically changing UI elements, detecting and responding to user interaction through IBActions, working with constants, using the range operator and randomization, as well as utilizing Swift variables and arrays to store data. This project was especially cool for me since it was my first experience creating something with actual functionality.
